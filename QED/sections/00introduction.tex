\chapter{Introduction}

More to come later, but a quick note:

\begin{center}
    It is assumed the reader has completed the IFT course given at Durham university or a similar course. The basic idea is that they are familiar with the second quantisation approach to QFT and understand the roles played by the relevant expressions/diagrams. We also assume you have seen the Lagrangian of QED.\footnote{This wasn't actually derived in IFT, so I might include an appendix to these notes on the derivation as its conceptually a bit different to the quantisation procedure of spin-0 and spin-1/2 particles.}
\end{center}

Make comment on how I'm going to use my usual notational choice for 
\bse 
    (\p A)^2 := \p_{\mu} A^{\mu} \p_{\nu} A^{\nu}
